# This is not to say that encryption guarantees confidentiality.
```
這並不是說加密可以保證機密性。
encryption 加密
guarantees 保證
```

# If an attacker can get to the key in some way, the attacker can then decrypt the data.
```
如果攻擊者可以某種方式獲得密鑰，則攻擊者可以解密數據。
decrypt 解密
```

# If the data is decrypted by someone who shouldn’t have seen it, confidentiality has of course been compromised
```
如果數據被不應該看到的人解密，那麼機密性當然會受到損害。
decrypted 解密
have seen it 看到了
been compromised 被妥協了
```

# Attacks against the encryption mechanisms—ciphers, key exchange algorithms, and so on—can also lead to a compromise of confidentiality.
```
attcks  攻擊者
encryption  加密
mechanisms    機制

exchange algorithms   交換演算法

encryption        加密

# In addition to having data be confidential, we also generally expect it to be the same from the moment we send it to the moment it’s received
```
addition 增加
data 數據
confidential 保密
generally 通常
expect 期望
moment 時刻
it to be the same from the moment we send it to the moment 從我們發送到那一刻起，它一直是一樣的
received 收到

除了對數據保密之外，我們通常也希望從發送數據到接收數據的時間都相同
```

# Additionally, if we store the data, we expect the same data to be intact when we retrieve it. This is a concept called integrity.
```
Additionally 此外
if we "store" 儲存
